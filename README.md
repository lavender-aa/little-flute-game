# Silly Little Flute Game
This is a little game based on the Animal Flute from Animal Well. 

# How to Play
There are two main methods you can use to play this game: 
- Using the Playdate emulator (found in the [Playdate SDK](https://play.date/dev/))
- Using a physical Playdate console

## Playdate Emulator
This is probably the easier option, but not as immersive (since you can only really use your keyboard to interface with the game, so there's no good option to represent the accelerometer or the crank). 
Here are the basic steps: 
1. Download [the SDK](https://play.date/dev/) (which includes an emulator)
2. Open the emulator (under [your path]/PlaydateSDK/bin/PlaydateSimulator.exe)
3. Drag the `little-flute-game.pdx` folder from the `builds/` folder into the emulator (or, alternatively, select File > Open > [find the `.pdx` folder] inside the emulator)
4. Have fun with the game!

## Real Playdate
Instructions for this are in the [Inside Playdate](https://sdk.play.date/2.5.0/Inside%20Playdate.html#_running_your_game_on_playdate_hardware) docs under section 3.4, but I'll copy them here:
1. Attach your Playdate to your computer via USB cable. 
2. Turn on your Playdate by pushing the Unlock button on top. 
3. Run your game in the Playdate Simulator. 
4. Choose Upload Game to Device from the Simulatorâ€™s Device menu. After the game is uploaded to your Playdate, it will start running automatically.
